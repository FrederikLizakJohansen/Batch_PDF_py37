# If "True" grid spacing will be determined by the Nyquist-Shannon theorem. For this to be done a cfg file is needed.

[Data]
file_name 	= Pt_L-
# Prename of the data series. E.g. whole name "Pt_L-00001.chi" gives a "file_name" = "Pt_L-". 
# The code inserts "00000" after "file_name" and increments, depending on starting value.

file_type	= .chi
# Is the format of the files.

first_file	= 2
# The first file which is imported.
# If equal 7 first file will have the extension "00007".

nr_files	= 100
# How many file the script will import starting from "first_file".

line_skip	= 4
# How number of header lines that will be skipped. This is without zero so 4 will skip 4 lines.



[Background_Data]

# This is the same os for "file_name".

# Same os for "file_type".

first_bg	= 4
# Same as for "first_file"

nr_bg_files	= 6
# Can be larger than "nr_files" but the first data set will get the first background file and so on. 
# If smaller than "nr_files" the last background file will be subtracked from the additional files.

# Same as "line_skip"

seq_bg 		= False
# Makes it possible to choose specific backgrounds.

bg_info 	= [3, 1, 21, 3, 13, 5, 22, 7]
# Takes a list. The list should be even in length. Numbers er relative to data. 
# [3, 1, 4, 7] takes background 3 and subtracts that background from frame 1-6 and takes background 4 and subtracts from frame 7 until the end. 



[Scaling]

# If "False" then multiple scaling factor will be determined.

auto		= True
# When "True" one or multiple scaling factors (depending on "calib_bg") will be calculated. 
# Depending on you qmin and qmax in the cfg file, the script will find highest possible scaling
# without allowing any negative values within that region.  

sumstep 	= 5
# Adds the y values of files together. 
# If "sumstep" % "nr_files" != 0 the script will return a warning. 
# sumstep is currently not available when seq_bg = True. 

sumstep_bg 	= 2
# Same as for sumstep

bg_scaling 	= 0.954
# This is only used if "calib_bg" is "True" and "auto" is "False", then bg i scaled with this factor

qnorm 		= 15.6
# This is only used if "calib_bg" is "False" and "auto" is "False", then each frame is scaled so that the background intensity matches data intensity at this q⁻1 value.

[Plotting]

show_all	= False
# Plots i(q), s(q), f(q) and G(r) of same frame.

save_pics 	= True
# Saves all pictures in a folder generated at the "cfg_dir". If "False" pictures are shown as they are made.

pdf_file 	= 5
